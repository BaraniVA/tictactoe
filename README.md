# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python. 

To play the game, simply run the tictactoe.py file:

           python tic_tac_toe.py
           
The game will ask you to choose whether you want to play as X or O, and then randomly choose who goes first. 

To make a move, enter a number between 1 and 9, corresponding to the position on the board:

           7 | 8 | 9
           ---------
           4 | 5 | 6
           ---------
           1 | 2 | 3
